# Least Fractional Differentiation Order

`LeastFracDiff` provides some minimal tools for finding an approximation to the least fractional difference order $d$ that transforms a time series into an stationary series, as suggested by de Prado (2018).

## Usage
```r
devtools::install_github("luisdamiano/LeastFracDiff", build_vignettes = TRUE)
vignette("ExampleSPY", package = "LeastFracDiff")
```
