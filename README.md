# Least Fractional Differentiation Order

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/luisdamiano/LeastFracDiff.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/luisdamiano/LeastFracDiff)

`LeastFracDiff` provides some minimal tools for finding an approximation to the least fractional difference order that transforms a time series into an stationary series, as suggested by de Prado (2018).

## Usage
```r
devtools::install_github("luisdamiano/LeastFracDiff", build_vignettes = TRUE)
vignette("ExampleSPY", package = "LeastFracDiff")
```

See vignette online [here](http://rpubs.com/luisdamiano/LeastFracDiff).
